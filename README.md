# What is OptiSched? 
OptiSched is an academic scheduling and operations platform that automates timetable generation, validation, and ongoing schedule management for schools and colleges. Headquartered in Meycauayan, Bulacan, OptiSched is designed to remove manual scheduling bottlenecks, reduce administrative workload, and increase operational reliability. The initial go-to-market focus is institutional licensing with STI College branches, with future rollout planned to other private secondary and tertiary institutions across the country.

By combining an extensive constraint engine with intuitive administrative tools and conversational AI assistants, OptiSched transforms term-end scheduling from a resource-intensive task into a rapid, repeatable process — clearing conflicts before they arise and putting control back in the hands of registrars and academic managers
