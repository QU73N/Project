# What is OptiSched? 
OptiSched is an academic scheduling and operations platform that automates timetable generation, validation, and ongoing schedule management for schools and colleges. Headquartered in Meycauayan, Bulacan, OptiSched is designed to remove manual scheduling bottlenecks, reduce administrative workload, and increase operational reliability. The initial go-to-market focus is institutional licensing with STI College branches, with future rollout planned to other private secondary and tertiary institutions across the country.

By combining an extensive constraint engine with intuitive administrative tools and conversational AI assistants, OptiSched transforms term-end scheduling from a resource-intensive task into a rapid, repeatable process — clearing conflicts before they arise and putting control back in the hands of registrars and academic managers

# OptiSched Overview
OptiSched combines a constraint-aware scheduling engine, an administrative visual editor, and student/manager schedule viewers augmented with conversational AI helpers. Core capabilities include:
●	Automated Schedule Generation: Enforces hard constraints (no teacher/room/section overlaps; capacity rules; subject–room compatibility) and optimizes soft objectives (teacher preferences, compact timetables, reduced idle gaps).

●	Comprehensive Data Modeling: Teachers, sections, subjects, rooms, curricula, blackout dates, and per-term rules are modeled to reflect real institutional policies.

●	Manual Override & Versioning: Drag-and-drop editing, locking, swap suggestions, undo/redo, and schedule snapshots allow safe manual adjustments.

●	User-Facing Tools: Student schedule viewer (mobile + web), administrator dashboard, and AI schedule managing assistants that accept natural-language instructions for common tasks (e.g., “Create a lab section for Grade 11 Science” or “Tell me the time of my first break on Monday”).

●	Integration & Exports: CSV/Excel imports and PDF/Excel exports for reporting and printing.
This combination of depth (constraint coverage) and usability (AI helpers + viewers) is positioned to materially reduce the time and error rate in timetable creation and maintenance.
